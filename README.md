GitHub repository for our final project of the 'Real-Time Intelligent Systems' course at the University of Chicago: https://github.com/ju-kl/real_time_trading_system

In this project, we built a real-time trading system that is capable of interacting with a fictitious stock market. Our trading system receives  market updates from a server and makes decisions based on the following three strategies: Correlation Strategy, Classification Strategy, and Cross-Over Strategy. The goal of each strategy is to maximize the return on the invested money.
