In this project, we built a real-time trading system that is capable of interacting with a fictitious stock market. Our trading system receives  market updates from a server and makes decisions based on the following three strategies: Correlation Strategy, Classification Strategy, and Cross-Over Strategy. The goal of each strategy is to maximize the return on the invested money. The project is structured along the following parts:

### 1. Server
- **server.py**: ...

### 2. Client
- **client.py**: ...

### 3. Order Book
- **limit_order_book.py**: ...

### 4. Portfolio
- **portfolio.py**: ...

### 5. Correlation Strategy
- **correlation_strategy.ipynb**: ...
- **correlation_strategy.py**: ...

### 6. Classification Strategy
- **model_building.py**: ...
- **gbc.sav**: ...
- **classification_strategy.py**: ...

### 7. Cross-Over Strategy
